- 👋 Hi, I’m @JuliusBruno
- 👀 I’m interested in mobile apps development and learning programming languages that I have not heard of yet. I am open to learning new things in the field.
- 🌱 I’m currently not into programming except a few fundamentals I have had back in college which read about occasionally.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing mobile apps to address records keeping in some government agencies with poor record keeping.
- 📫 How to reach me is not difficult. Get in touch at juliusbruno@hotmail.com
